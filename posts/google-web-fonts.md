Google Fonts web fonts: slow and buggy. The service that promised to democratize typography on the web has become a liability for performance-conscious developers.

When Google Fonts was first introduced, it seemed like a revolutionary solution. Free, high-quality fonts delivered via CDN with automatic optimization. But over the years, the reality has been far from the promise.

## Performance Issues

The primary concern with Google Fonts is performance. Every request to fonts.googleapis.com adds latency to your page load. Even with preloading, the fonts still need to be downloaded and processed by the browser.

Consider this: a typical Google Fonts request includes multiple font weights and styles, each requiring a separate HTTP request. For a single font family with regular, bold, and italic variants, you're looking at 6-8 requests minimum.

## Reliability Problems

Beyond performance, there are serious reliability concerns. Google Fonts has experienced multiple outages over the years, leaving websites with fallback fonts or no fonts at all. For a service that's supposed to be production-ready, this is unacceptable.

The GDPR implications are also concerning. Google Fonts has been declared illegal in some jurisdictions due to data collection practices. This creates legal uncertainty for websites serving European users.

## Better Alternatives

Fortunately, there are better approaches:

1. **Self-hosting**: Download and serve fonts from your own server
2. **Font-display: swap**: Use modern CSS to prevent layout shifts
3. **Variable fonts**: Reduce the number of font files needed
4. **System fonts**: Fall back to high-quality system fonts

## The Future

The web font landscape is evolving. Variable fonts offer incredible flexibility with minimal file sizes. Modern CSS features like `font-display` provide better control over font loading behavior.

For serious projects, consider using the master Github versions of fonts and serving them yourself. This gives you complete control over performance and reliability.

The era of relying on third-party font services may be coming to an end. As developers become more performance-conscious, the trade-offs of Google Fonts become harder to justify.
